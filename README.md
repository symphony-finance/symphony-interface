# Symphony Finance

[Symphony Finance](https://symphony.finance) allows users to create limit orders by depositing the sell asset. The order is filled automatically by an "Executor" who takes a fee to execute the orders only if the order's price constraints are satisfied. The sell asset is deposited to a yield generating protocol like Aave, Yearn, Mstable, etc.

This feature allows limit orders to earn yield for the time they are on the order book. The initial deposit + yield earned are traded for the buy asset by the executor only if the price constraints are satisfied. The order creator receives the buy assets automatically when the order is filled. The order creator can also set a stop loss to minimise losses while still earning yield.
